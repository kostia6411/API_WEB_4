[Intro]
(Get up)
(Get up)
(Get up)
[Verse 1]
Wake up with the fear of livin' for another day
Tell myself that it's nothing that I can't take
Your strengths was the sickness I can't hide
I tried to be invisible to him
Make no noise, tip toe through everything
Hell's fury feeds the fear inside
[Chorus]
It's like acid rain in a hurricane
But here you come to bring me cover
It's a crown of thorns, leaving me torn
But here you come to bring me cover
[Post-Chorus]
Oh-ooh-oh-ooh
[Verse 2]
I made choices that I cannot livе with
I regret not choosing you over him
I'm suffocating in this lifе
Don't know if I can survive this weather
And your turn up with your arms and umbrella
I sent a flare up tonight
