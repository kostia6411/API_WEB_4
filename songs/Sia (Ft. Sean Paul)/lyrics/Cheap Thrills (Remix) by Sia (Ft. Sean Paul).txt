[Intro: Sean Paul]
Up with it, girl
Rock with it, girl (Sia)
Show dem it, girl (Bada bang, bang)
Bounce with it, girl
Dance with it, girl
Get with it, girl (Bada bang, bang)
[Verse 1: Sia]
Come on, come on, turn the radio on
It's Friday night and I won't be long
Gotta do my hair, put my make-up on
It's Friday night and I won't be long
[Pre-Chorus: Sia & 
Sean Paul
]
'Til I hit the dance floor (
Bada bang
)
Hit the dance floor (
Bada bang
)
I got all I need
No, I ain't got cash, I ain't got cash
But I got you, baby
(
Just you and me
)
[Chorus: Sia & 
Sean Paul
]
Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills)
Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills)
I don't need no money
You're worth more dan diamond, more dan gold
As long as I can feel the beat
Mek di beat jus tek control
I don't need no money
You're worth more dan diamond, more dan gold
As long as I keep dancing
Free up yourself, get outta control
