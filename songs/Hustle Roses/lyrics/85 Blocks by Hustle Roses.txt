[Verse 1]
85 blocks
On the rocks
Taking my time
Watch it unwind
Used to be black
Wish Apollo was back
James Brown's looking down at the Harlem hipsters
Cigarettes butts
Ten tow trucks
Japs in gold
Watch it unfold
Jogging bankers
Capitalist wankers
Sweating bullets of green
Through strawberry fields
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not taking a cab
Not taking a subway
When I leave the bar
I'd rather gum on my shoe
I'm walking my shame off
So I gotta walk far
[Chorus]
New York means hitting the skids
I love this holy misfit
Here's where the weirdos unite
Trying to revive the good inside
New York means hitting the skids
I love this holy misfit
Here's where the weirdos unite
Trying to revive the good inside
