[Verse 1]
You can be my alphabet and I will be your calculator
And together we'll work out on the escalator
I will time you as you run up to down
And you'll measure my footsteps as I blow through this town
The mean of our heights is divided by the nights
Which is timesed by the daggers in the root of all our fights
The pass of your poem is to swathe me in your knowing
And the beauty of the word is that you don't have to show it
[Chorus]
Oh, academia, you can pick me up
Soothe me with your words when I need your love
[Verse 2]
I am a dash and you're a dot
When will you see that I am all that you've got?
I'm a binary code that you've cracked long ago
But to you I'm just a novel that you wish you never wrote
I'm greater than X and lesser than Y, so why is it
That I still can't catch your eye?
You're a cryptic crossword, a song I've never heard
While I sit here drawing circles, I'm afraid of being hurt
[Chorus]
Oh, academia, you can pick me up
Soothe me with your words when I need your love
