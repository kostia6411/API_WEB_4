[Intro]
Up, I won't give up, I won't give up
I won't give up, I won't give up
[Verse 1]
And another one bites the dust
Oh, why can I not conquer love?
And I might have thought that we were one
Wanted to fight this war without weapons
And I wanted it, I wanted it bad
But there were so many red flags
Now another one bites the dust
Yeah, let's be clear, I'll trust no one
[Pre-Chorus]
You did not break me
I'm still fighting for peace
[Chorus]
Well, I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade, it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
Yeah, I may snap and I move fast
But you won't see me fall apart
'Cause I've got an elastic heart
