[Verse 1]
Get a girl, or get a boy
One plus one
Take 'em right down to the shore
One plus one
Give your all and give some more
One plus one
Let the music free your soul
One plus one
[Pre-Chorus]
Sway with me to the light
Hold me for just one night
Hold me for just one night (Whoah)
We live for the beat
Baby, you're all I need
Baby, you're all I need (Ohh)
[Chorus]
So I'm taking you away
One plus one
Every day's a holiday
One plus one
Move your body, feel the sway
Grab someone
Every day's a holiday
One plus one
Every day's a holiday
Let the beat take you away
Let the beat take you today
Baby, this is magic
Every day's a holiday
Let the beat take you away
Let the beat take you today
Baby, this is magic
