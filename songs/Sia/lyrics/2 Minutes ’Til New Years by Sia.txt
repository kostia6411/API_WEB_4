[Verse 1]
Whether you're partying out, whether you're partying at home
Partying together or partying alone
It's gonna be a happy new year, not too long
Come with me, this is my New Year's song
Let's count, baby, I'll tell you when
I'll tell you when and then we're gonna scream
[Pre-Chorus]
Balloons to burst, it's December 31st (Woo)
Balloons to burst, it's December 31st (Woo)
Balloons to burst, it's December 31st (Woo)
Balloons to burst, it's December 31st (Woo)
(Oh) Balloons to burst
(Yeah) Balloons to burst
Balloons to burst
[Chorus]
If you've had a happy year
Or a sad year
It's a nеw year, now there's nothing to fеar
No, nothing to fear, now, no
Oh, there's nothing to fear
It's a new year
We got balloons to burst
