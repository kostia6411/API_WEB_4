[Chorus]
Oh Santa, I adore ya
Oh, I'll be waiting for ya
Rudolph and his explorers
Twelve nights 'til Christmas Day is here
[Chorus]
Oh Santa, I adore ya
Oh, I'll be waiting for ya
Rudolph and his explorers
Eleven nights 'til Christmas Day is here
[Chorus]
Oh, oh Santa, I adore ya
Oh, I'll be waiting for ya
Rudolph and his explorers
Ten nights 'til Christmas Day is here
It's getting closer, getting closer, getting closer
[Chorus]
Oh Santa, I adore ya
Oh, I'll be waiting for ya
Rudolph and his explorers
Nine nights 'til Christmas Day is here, oh-oh
[Chorus]
Oh Santa, I adore ya
Oh, I'll be waiting for ya
Rudolph and his explorers
Eight nights 'til Christmas Day is here
Only еight nights, oh
