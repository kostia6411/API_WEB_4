Putting makeup on
Feeling so fancy
Take it from the bottom of my heart
I'll be here friendly
Keep it to yourself
Those apologies
The life we livin' now
Will never like me
And I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I never had your back
Forgive me, I know
I'm a self lack of art
You told me you promised you'll never be a liar
But I keep telling myself
I'm afraid of you
Afraid of you
