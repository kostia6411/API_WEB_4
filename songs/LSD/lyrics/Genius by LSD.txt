[Intro: Sia]
Labrinth
[Verse 1: Labrinth]
Do you think I'm stupid?
Do you think I'm batshit crazy havin' you on my mind?
Do you think I'm helpless?
My algebra gon' equal you every time
Do you think I'm callin'?
Do you think I'm callin' out your name every night?
Girl, I have fallen for you
(
What, what you say?
)
[Pre-Chorus: Sia & 
Labrinth
]
Oh my God
Baby, baby, don't you see-ee-ee?
I got everything you nee-ee-eed
O-only a genius could love a woman like she
Oh my God
Baby, baby, don't you see-ee-ee?
I got everything you nee-ee-eed
O-o-only a genius could love a woman like she
[Chorus: Labrinth & 
Sia
]
I'm a ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-genius
A ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-genius

He's a genius
'Cause I love a woman like you
I'm a ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-genius
A ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-genius

He-he's a genius
'Cause I love a woman like you
