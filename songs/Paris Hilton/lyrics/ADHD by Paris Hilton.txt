[Verse 1]
Got on a plane, got in the car
I'm so tired
Live with the pain, live with my scars
I'm so tired
I wish I could sleep, I'm ADHD
I'm so tired
But this is all mine, this is all me
Now I'm on fire
[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes I wanna fight it
Sometimes I freeze, I fly, yeah
Sometimes I can't deny it
So I just keep on trying
Sometimes I wanna crumble
Sometimes I'm gonna stumble
My mind is always runnin'
Sometimes I feel like cryin'
[Chorus]
Now, look at me, I'm the best I can be
I was so down, thought I'd never be free
My superpower was right inside, see?
It was ADHD
My hands were shy, yeah, could never be me
Look at me now as I laugh nervously
My superpower was right inside, see?
